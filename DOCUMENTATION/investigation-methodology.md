# Investigation Methodology

Each case in this repository follows a `structured investigation lifecycle.`

**1. Case Intake:**

- Understanding complaint nature
- Defining scope and limitations
- Identifying investigation objectives

**2. Information Collection:**

- Open-source intelligence (OSINT)
- Platform policy analysis
- Metadata visible to public users

**3. Analysis:**

- Pattern identification
- Behavioral indicators
- Timeline reconstruction

**4. Evidence Documentation:**

- Screenshots (redacted)
- Observational notes
- Structured evidence logs

**5. Conclusion:**

- Findings summary
- Risk assessment
- Resolution status

This methodology mirrors standard `DFIR (Digital Forensics & Incident Response)`
workflows used by `cyber crime cells` and `security operations teams`.
