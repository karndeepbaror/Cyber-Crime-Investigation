# Evidence Handling & Preservation

Evidence handling is a critical component of `cyber crime investigation.`

**Evidence Principles Followed:**

- Integrity preservation
- Minimal handling
- Clear documentation
- Ethical acquisition

**Evidence Types Used:**

- Screenshots of publicly accessible content
- Username and profile comparisons
- Visible timestamps and activity indicators

**Chain of Custody (Simulated):**

- Evidence is documented immediately
- No modification after collection
- Stored in read-only formats
- Clearly marked as simulated

No `real user data`, `private communications,` or `restricted information`
is accessed or stored at any `stage.`
